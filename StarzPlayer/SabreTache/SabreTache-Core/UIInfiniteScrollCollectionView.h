/*! UICollectionView implementation, which renders its cells in an infinite
 *  way.
 *  It achieves this, by defining a Canonical Domain containing the presentation
 *  of the data according to users's specs, and tiling the space around this domain
 *  with visually equivalent copies.
 *
 *  After this, upon layout it uses transformations, so that when it leaves the 
 *  Canonical Domain, it goes back to it in a way, that presentation of data is 
 *  visually equivalent after the transformation.
 *
 *  Usage is identical to any conventional UICollectionViews. Users of this class
 *  should not add any redundancy to their original model to provide impression of
 *  infinite scrolling, it is handled by the control.
 *
 *  TODO: Currently only UICollectionViewFlowLayout is supported.
