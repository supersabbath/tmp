/**
 A `WebServiceAdapter` is a general WebService Client class, which encapsulates the
 HTTP client and Object Mapping framework, and maintains a collection of `BaseWebServiceResource`
 singleton instances.
 
 Using the provided convenience macros, an intuitive WebService client hierarchy can be produced.
 
 ## Subclassing notes
 
 If your app needs to call an HTTP service which is conforming to a specfic behaviour, you can
 subclass `WebServiceAdapter` to encapsulate the inner logic of that service.
 
 The client will be represented by a tree of `WebServiceComponent` instances, with a 
 `WebServiceAdapter` as a root node.
 
 
 The main benefit of this solution is a very intuitive and consistent usage pattern:
 
        [[MyNeatService instance].user getById:userid onSuccess:^(User * result) {
          [self updateWithUser:result];
        } onFailure:^(NSError * error) {
          [self myCoolErrorHandler:error];
        }];
 
 The hierarchy can be as deep as necessary. The nodes do not have to correspond to
 request paths on the service, however in most cases that gives a reasonable structure
 and can be a good starting point.
 
 @see `BaseWebServiceResource` for more details.
